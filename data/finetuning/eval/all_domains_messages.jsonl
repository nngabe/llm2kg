A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (Figure 1.9) is a prime example of a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In a market economy, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies are based on private enterprise: the private individuals or groups of private individuals own and operate the means of production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, the government owns resources and businesses.) Supply of goods and services depends on what the demands are. A person\u2019s income is based on their ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values the person\u2019s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James).

nonnegative, which is what the energy relation Equation 7.53 says. Physically, it means that a classical oscillator can never be found beyond its turning points, and its energy depends only on how far the turning points are from its equilibrium position. The energy of a classical oscillator changes in a continuous way. The lowest energy that a classical oscillator may have is zero, which corresponds to a situation where an object is at rest at its equilibrium position. The zero-energy state of a classical oscillator simply means no oscillations and no motion at all (a classical particle sitting at the bottom of the potential well in Figure 7.13).

Therefore, the probability of finding a classical oscillator between the turning points is highest near the turning points and lowest at the equilibrium position.

To move onto the transfer ellipse from Earth\u2019s orbit, we will need to increase our kinetic energy, that is, we need a velocity boost. The most efficient method is a very quick acceleration along the circular orbital path, which is also along the path of the ellipse at that point.

In practice, the finite acceleration is short enough that the difference is not a significant consideration.)

In order for the lamp to light, there must be a complete path for current flow.
