      "question": "How does a GE Vernova H-class combined-cycle plant's CO2 emissions compare to a coal-fired plant?",
      "expected_answer": "60% less CO2 emissions compared to a similarly sized coal-fired asset",
      "actual_answer": "[Note: This answer includes information from web search.]\n\nA modern GE Vernova H\u2011class combined\u2011cycle power plant, which burns natural gas in a high\u2011efficiency Brayton cycle, typically emits on the order of 350\u2013450\u202fg\u202fCO\u2082 per kilowatt\u2011hour (kWh) of electricity generated. In contrast, a conventional coal\u2011fired steam plant emits roughly 820\u20131,000\u202fg\u202fCO\u2082 per kWh. Consequently, the H\u2011class combined\u2011cycle facility releases about 50\u201365\u202f% less carbon dioxide than a typical coal plant when producing the same amount of electricity.\n\nThis difference stems from two factors: (1) natural gas contains fewer carbon atoms per unit of energy than coal, and (2) combined\u2011cycle technology recovers waste heat from the gas turbine to drive a steam turbine, raising overall thermal efficiency (often >60\u202f% versus 33\u201340\u202f% for most coal plants). The lower emission factor is reflected in life\u2011cycle assessments that compare whole\u2011system greenhouse\u2011gas footprints.\n\n**Key points of the comparison**\n- **Emission intensity**: ~350\u2013450\u202fg\u202fCO\u2082/kWh (GE H\u2011class) vs. ~820\u20131,000\u202fg\u202fCO\u2082/kWh (coal).\n- **Why lower**: higher plant efficiency and the intrinsic lower carbon content of natural gas.\n- **Environmental impact**: The combined\u2011cycle plant therefore contributes substantially fewer greenhouse\u2011gas emissions per unit of electricity, aligning with climate\u2011mitigation goals that prioritize low\u2011carbon generation.\n\n**Sources**\n1. Wikipedia \u2013 *Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources* (indicates coal is the worst emitter and natural gas is next, providing the baseline for comparative emission intensities).\n2. Wikipedia \u2013 *Gas-turbine engine* (describes the Brayton\u2011cycle operation of modern combined\u2011cycle plants and their higher efficiency relative to simple steam cycles).",
