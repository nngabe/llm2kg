General guidance indicates that the allowable blend ratio is limited by factors such as material compatibility, flame speed, and emissions performance, meaning the turbine can be configured for low\u2011level hydrogen mixing (typically a few percent by energy) while maintaining reliability and meeting emission targets. No specific figure for the 9HA\u2019s hydrogen capability is provided in the sources examined.\n\n[Source: Wikipedia: Gas turbines \u2013 \"Hydrogen can be blended with natural gas, but the permissible blend ratio depends on material compatibility, flame speed, emissions...\"]",
