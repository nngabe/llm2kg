In November 2021, GE announced plans to split into three independent public companies. GE HealthCare was spun off in January 2023, followed by the spin-off of GE's energy businesses in April 2024 to create GE Vernova from the merger of GE Power, GE Renewable Energy, GE Digital, and GE Energy Financial Services."

      "actual_answer": "The LM2500XPRESS gas turbine package is designed for rapid deployment and quick start\u2011up.  It can achieve a full start from a cold state in approximately **5 minutes**, enabling it to provide fast power when needed and support high cycling operations with multi\u2011day start/stop capabilities.  This fast\u2011start performance is highlighted as part of its modular, factory\u2011assembled design that emphasizes speed and flexibility for applications requiring rapid response.\n\n**Key fast\u2011start attributes**:\n- **~5\u2011minute start time** (specification listed for LM2500XPRESS on gas fuel)\n- **High cycling capability** allowing frequent start/stop cycles without compromising reliability\n- **Modular assembly** (up to 95% factory\u2011built) that reduces on\u2011site installation time and accelerates commissioning\n- **Ability to ramp up quickly**, supporting grid firming and emergency or temporary power needs\nThese characteristics make the LM2500XPRESS one of GE Vernova\u2019s fastest\u2011responding aeroderivative gas turbines.\n\n**Citations**:\n1.
