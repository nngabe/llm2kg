      "question": "How does a GE Vernova H-class combined-cycle plant's CO2 emissions compare to a coal-fired plant?",
      "expected_answer": "60% less CO2 emissions compared to a similarly sized coal-fired asset",
      "actual_answer": "[Note: This answer includes information from web search.]\n\nA GE Vernova H\u2011class combined\u2011cycle plant is a high\u2011efficiency natural\u2011gas power station.  Based on industry\u2011wide life\u2011cycle assessments, such plants typically emit on the order of **350\u2013450\u202fg\u202fCO\u2082\u2011eq per kilowatt\u2011hour (kWh)** (\u22480.35\u20130.45\u202ft\u202fCO\u2082/MWh).  By contrast, a conventional coal\u2011fired power plant emits roughly **800\u20131,000\u202fg\u202fCO\u2082\u2011eq per kWh** (\u22480.8\u20131.0\u202ft\u202fCO\u2082/MWh).  Consequently, on a per\u2011kWh basis the H\u2011class combined\u2011cycle facility releases only about **35\u201345\u202f%** of the carbon dioxide that a typical coal plant emits.  The exact figure for any specific plant depends on factors such as turbine inlet temperature, fuel composition, part\u2011load operation, and the life\u2011cycle boundaries considered (e.g., upstream methane leakage).  Nevertheless, the comparative trend is clear: natural\u2011gas combined\u2011cycle technology, especially the advanced H\u2011class designs, markedly reduces CO\u2082 emissions relative to coal\u2011based generation.\n\nThis comparison aligns with the broader findings reported in life\u2011cycle greenhouse\u2011gas emission studies, which consistently rank coal as the highest emitter and natural\u2011gas combined\u2011cycle as a low\u2011carbon alternative.\n\n**Key take\u2011aways**\n- **Emission intensity**: ~0.35\u20130.45\u202fkg\u202fCO\u2082/kWh for GE Vernova H\u2011class vs. ~0.8\u20131.0\u202fkg\u202fCO\u2082/kWh for coal.\n- **Relative reduction**: roughly a 60\u202f% lower CO\u2082 output per unit of electricity generated.\n- **Implications**: helps meet climate targets by lowering the carbon intensity of the electricity mix, especially when replacing older, less efficient coal units.",
