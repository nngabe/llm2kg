          "answer": "Expansionary monetary policy is implemented when a central bank lowers its policy interest rate or injects additional reserves, thereby reducing borrowing costs and expanding the money supply. The cheaper credit encourages firms to invest and households to consume, which shifts the aggregate\u2011demand (AD) curve to the right (Context 2). A rightward shift in AD raises real output until the economy approaches its potential; any further increase in demand then translates into upward pressure on the price level. Because inflation is defined as a sustained rise in the general price level (Context 3), this upward pressure can become persistent, especially when expectations of future inflation adjust and wage\u2011price setting accelerates. The transmission channel also works through the exchange rate: lower domestic rates tend to depreciate the currency, boosting net exports and further supporting AD (Context 4 & 5). In addition, an increase in the money supply directly influences aggregate demand by affecting credit impulse and debt capacity, reinforcing the rightward shift of the AD curve (Context 5). When the economy is near full employment, these mechanisms can generate inflationary pressures that may require a tightening of monetary policy to preserve price stability.\n\nMechanistic chain:\n1. **Policy action** \u2013 central bank reduces interest rates / expands money supply (Context 1 & 4).\n2. **Credit and spending response** \u2013 lower borrowing costs stimulate investment, consumption, and net exports.\n3. **Aggregate\u2011demand shift** \u2013 higher spending shifts AD rightward (Context 2 & 5).\n4. **Output and price effects** \u2013 output rises until capacity is reached; excess demand raises prices.\n5. **Inflation outcome** \u2013 sustained price increases constitute inflation (Context 3).",

It does not include any up\u2011to\u2011date quantitative information on the current U.S. inflation rate nor details about recent Federal Reserve policy decisions such as interest\u2011rate changes or balance\u2011sheet actions. Consequently, based solely on the retrieved context I cannot state the present inflation figure (e.g., 2025 CPI) or specify the Fed\u2019s latest monetary\u2011policy moves; those data would need to be obtained from more recent external sources.",

          "answer": "Keynesian economics holds that active government intervention is necessary during recessions to stabilize aggregate demand. It argues that because prices and wages are sticky, a drop in private spending can leave the economy persistently under\u2011employed, so fiscal stimulus (e.g., increased public spending or tax cuts) and accommodative monetary policy should be used to boost demand and bring output back toward potential [Source: Keynesian Economics]. \n\nNeoclassical economics, by contrast, assumes that markets are generally efficient and self\u2011correcting. It maintains that recessions are temporary disequilibria that will resolve once prices and resources adjust, and therefore it favors minimal government interference\u2014often limiting policy to maintaining a stable macro\u2011environment rather than actively stimulating demand [Source: Neoclassical Economics]. \n\nKey contrasts:\n- **Role of Government**: Keynesians advocate deliberate, counter\u2011cyclical fiscal and monetary policies; neoclassicals view such interventions as likely to distort price signals and prefer reliance on market forces.\n- **Assumptions about Prices/Wages**: Keynesians emphasize short\u2011run rigidities and the possibility of prolonged unemployment; neoclassicals assume flexible prices that quickly restore equilibrium.\n- **Long\u2011Run Focus**: Neoclassical theory is grounded in long\u2011run optimality and rational expectations, whereas Keynesian analysis focuses on short\u2011run demand management to affect real variables like output and employment.\n- **Policy Stance During Recessions**: Keynesians support active stabilization policies (e.g., stimulus packages); neoclassicals typically oppose them, arguing that allowing the market to adjust naturally is preferable [Source: Active Stabilization Policy].",
